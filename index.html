Let me tell you a little story about a man I know.
His name is Nicholas Paco Resendez. 
He is my son. 
He is the best son in the whole world. 
He loves me and I love him. 
I am so proud of him. He has done so much with his life and his perspective in everything. His morals, beliefs.
The knowledge he has aquired and is using.
He might not know it but what he does and learned is very high. 
Not a lot of people his age have the capabilities he has and charisma and forward thinking.
There is so much more to say. I try to be good with my words but I do not have the education he has and self-discipline.
With all my heart I love you so much that words can never describe.
